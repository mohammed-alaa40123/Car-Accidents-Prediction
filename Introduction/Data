 Data

Description
The data set used in the present study is provided through the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone
Course [4]. The raw data set contains car accident information in Seattle from 2004 to 2020. The raw
data set contains 194,673 entries of accidents with 38 descriptive features (columns).

Preliminary Data Preprocessing
The data set has some duplicate entries. We first drop the duplicated rows. This reduced the data set to
189,542 rows.
Some of the entries also contain Nan values. For example, two of the features that we consider as
independent variables, road condition and weather condition, contain 5012 and 5081 Nan values,
respectively. We will remove the Nan values for the exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling.
In the exploratory data analysis session, we will mostly be focused on analyzing subsets of selected
features of the data. Thus, in this phase, we will drop Nan values in each of the subsets selected for the
analysis. In the later predictive modeling phase where we apply a machine learning approach, we will
drop all Nan values in the dataset that is used by the machine learning algorithm. Additional data preprocessing will be applied. 
Some of the columns in the data set contain redundant information or information that is not very
relevant for the purpose of the present analysis, such as, “INCKEY”, “COLDETKEY”, and “SEVERITYDESC,”
etc., and therefore, are dropped. Some other data columns are not very clear. For example, the
“SPEEDING” feature contains only “Y” and “nan” values, and it’s not clear how many of the “nan” entries
are actually speeding violations. Therefore, such columns are also dropped. In addition, the date and
time information are converted into three additional feature parameters: “year”, “dayofweek”, and
“hour”. A full description of the feature parameters used in the present study are listed in Table 1. All
other features of the original data set [4] that are not listed in Table 1 are dropped.
